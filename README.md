# COVID-19 in New Zealand

This repository contains the results of a coursework project on **data analysis and visualization** of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand.

## Repository Contents

* **data/** – datasets used in the analysis
* **scripts/** – Python scripts for generating plots and visualizations
* **report/** – HTML report summarizing results
* **poster** – project poster with key findings

## Project Overview

We chose New Zealand as a case study because of its unique position as an island nation with strong border controls and reliable public health records. The analysis focuses on:

* **Case dynamics** – daily and weekly trends, including the Omicron wave in early 2022
* **Vaccination rollout** – progress of first doses, full vaccination, and boosters
* **Regional spread** – differences in infections between Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury, and rural areas
* **Demographics** – cases by age and gender
* **Comparisons** – New Zealand vs. Poland case trajectories
* **Forecasting** – models of new case trends and uncertainty
* **Correlation analysis** – relationships among cases, deaths, vaccinations, testing, and policy measures

## Key Findings

* Early border closures, strict lockdowns, and high vaccination coverage kept cases and deaths relatively low.
* Over **90%** of eligible people were fully vaccinated, and more than **70%** received boosters.
* Regional differences highlight the importance of tailored local measures.
* Vaccinations were strongly associated with reduced hospitalizations.
* By 2024, daily cases stabilized at only a few hundred, showing sustained control of the virus.
